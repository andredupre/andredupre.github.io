Eloquent Javascript Chapter 1: Values, Types, and Operators

--- Values ---

Bits are two-value, binary things.

Here are eight bits used to represent any numeric value:

   0   0   0   0   1   1   0   1
 128  64  32  16   8   4   2   1

So thatâ€™s the binary number 00001101, 
or 8 + 4 + 1, which equals 13.
